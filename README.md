Minimal file exploror for Vim.

‚ö†Ô∏è **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Currently, only for \*nix. Windows is not supported.

## Getting started

To start a file explorer, run a command that starts editing files, giving the path to the directory you want to open.

**Examples:**

* Open current directory in the current window.
    ```
    edit .
    ```

* Open parent directory of current buffer in the vertical split window.
    ```
    vsplit %:h
    ```
