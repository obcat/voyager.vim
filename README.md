Minimal file exploror written in Vim9 script.

**LIMITATIONS**

* This plugin is written in Vim9 script, but the specification of Vim9 is not
yet stable. I guarantee this works fine on the Vim that I use, but it is also
not stable. In other words, you shouldn't use this plugin.

* Currently, only for \*nix. Windows is not supported.

## Getting started

To start a file explorer, run a command that starts editing files, giving the
path to the directory you want to open.

**Examples:**

* Open the current directory in the current window.
    ```
    edit .
    ```

* Open the parent directory of current buffer in the vertical split window.
    ```
    vsplit %:h
    ```
